# YoloTaskManager

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 20.0.0 with a [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) backend.

## Prerequisites:

Python 3.8+

Node.js 22+ 

# Quick Start (Recommended)
Added a small script to run both front-end and back-end with minimal input required.
```bash
npm run start-project
```
This command initializes both the front-end and back-end. After that, simply visit the localhost provided.

Front-end website: http://localhost:4200/

Back-end API documentation: http://localhost:8000/docs#

Make sure both are running in order for the project to work.

## Manual Start
If there are issues to the quick start command. It is possible to manually start it

### For the frontend
Simply start from the root and type -

```bash
npm start
```

### For the backend
Navigate to the task-backend in the terminal.

```bash
cd task-backend
```

#### Generate the backend
This initializes the venv folder for the project. You only need to generate this once. After that you can skip this segment.
### Windows
```bash
python -m venv venv
```
### macOS/Linux
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```
## Running the backend
Run this to enter the virtual enviroment.
### Windows
```bash
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```
### macOS/Linux
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

Once inside, you can initiate the back-end with this command.
```bash
Fastapi dev
```
After running both commands, you can access the following local servers:

Front-end and main website: http://localhost:4200/

Back-end API documentation: http://localhost:8000/docs#
